<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://blog.efpsa.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/OA-week.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-589" style="margin-right: 3px; margin-left: 3px;" title="OA week" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/OA-week.jpg" alt="" width="86" height="173" /></a><a href="http://www.openaccessweek.org/">Open Access Week</a></span> is spreading around the globe! Attend lectures, seminars, weminars, discussions, conferences, workshops, webcast or meetings at the university or institution closest to you. What am I talking about? This month, from October 24th to October 30th, people interested in Open Access are gathering to talk about, get informed or just share their experience with open access.</p>
<p>Everybody from activists and students to professors and researchers and all those in between are organizing a bunch of events all around the globe - and a fair share of those are in Europe. If you're interested in OA, this might be the perfect opportunity to deepen that interest, learn something new and meet new interesting people (who are into OA of course).</p>
