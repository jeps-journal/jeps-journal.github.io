He is noted for his research on happiness and creativity, on which he published over 120 scientific articles and book chapters. He is also well known for introducing the concept of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)">flow</a> in his seminal work "<a href="http://books.google.nl/books/about/Flow.html?id=epmhVuaaoK0C&amp;redir_esc=y">Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience</a>".</td>

<p><strong style="line-height: 1.5em;">What I enjoy most about my job as a researcher ...  </strong>two things: the early analysis of data, when you are looking for patterns — exploring the psychological landscape, so to speak. Then the last part, when you start writing and trying to find the best way to express what you have learned.<!--more--></p>
<p><strong>The biggest challenge in my career so far was ...</strong> to break out of the two reigning paradigms of my student's days; the Freudian and the Skinnerian approaches.</p>
<p><strong>One research project I will never forget is… </strong>perhaps the few months in 1968 when we started collecting data on the flow experience with a group of students at the college I was teaching at at the  time, Lake Forest College.</p>
<p><strong>What I look for in a student who wants to work under my supervision ...</strong> besides the obvious ones (academic and intellectual abilities): intrinsic motivation, a sense of humor, lack of excessive egotism.</p>
<p><strong>Student research could be improved by ... </strong>learning that what matters is engagement in a worth-while project.</p>
<p><strong>Academically, I most admire</strong> ... my friend Howard Gardner ...  <strong>because</strong> .... he is an unselfish, sophisticated intellectual.</p>
<p><strong>I wish someone had told me at the beginning of my career ...</strong> how to get financial support for conducting large-scale research — although I probably would have ignored the advice anyway . . .</p>
<p><strong>The largest changes in psychological science in the next 10 years will be ... </strong>I am not a prophet, alas, so I have no idea. I know that the best-case scenario would be for psychology to focus on human experience, and establish conceptual links with other social sciences like sociology, anthropology, history, economics, and political science . . . The worst-case scenario would be selling out to neurobiology, and becoming a sub-discipline of that field. But I have no clue as to which of these two scenarios will win out in the evolutionary process.</p>
