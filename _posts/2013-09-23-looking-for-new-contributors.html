Currently, the JEPS Bulletin is recruiting new Contributors so in case you want to be part of the list on your left keep reading.</p>

<p><strong></strong><b>Your application should include:</b></p>
<p><b>1.</b> An<b> abstract </b>(between 150-300 words) and key references of the topic you wish to write about. You may write on a topic of your choice if it fits with the Bulletin's theme, or you may pick a topic from our list of suggestions (see below).</p>

<p>There is no deadline for applying, as the JEPS Bulletin always accepts blog post submissions. Nonetheless, we encourage potential Contributors to contact us as soon as possible because we operate on a "first come, first served" basis and the longer you wait for applying, the likelier it gets that your post will be published at a later time. When you are done send the application to <strong>journal@efpsa.org.</strong></p>
