<p>Writing scientific texts is inevitable in Academia. Publishing good articles is a crucial factor in one’s scientific career. Nevertheless, the students often concentrate on <em>what</em> to write, rather than <em>how</em> to write. This blog is launched to help students to become acquainted with the latter.</p>
<p>The JEPS Bulletin will elaborate on many different aspects of writing and publishing. First, we introduce you to the <strong>authors’ experience</strong> starring students who have published in JEPS or somewhere else, so that they could share their endeavour with you. Of course, we then cannot neglect the opinions of the reviewers, who undoubtedly gain many insights having read tens or hundreds of manuscripts before they have been published in peer-reviewed journals. Read more about their insights under <strong>reviewer’s experiences</strong>.</p>
<p>Having had a sneak peak into all those experiences, you will probably feel inspired to go for it yourself. At this point we will take you by the hand and guide you through the process of <strong>writing a scientific text </strong>providing all the information you would need to produce a high standard scientific text of your own. We aim underpin all the important points, and to further enhance your practical knowledge on writing techniques, structure, dos and don'ts etc. Furthermore, we will demonstrate to you a full <strong>manuscript analysis</strong> of different texts written by other students and analysed by experienced reviewers. Naturally we cannot overlook the <strong>APA manual </strong>(<em>Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association). </em>We’ll look into the rules of APA style, which has been adapted by many disciplines and is used by academics around the world.</p>
<p>We hope that all of the above will fully equip you to write a text that will make you proud of yourself. Once you are done and eager to share it with peers, you can seek guidance under <strong>publishing in scientific journals. </strong></p>
<p>Furthermore, as source of inspiration and encouragement, we will bring <strong>interviews</strong> with a number of interesting people who have great knowledge on these topics.</p>
<p>To sum, our aim is to establish a good quality medium for online knowledge and experience transfer in the field of scientific publishing. In order to achieve this aim, we welcome <strong>your contributions</strong>. You can post to this blog, share your experiences – may they be good or bad, or simply suggest us what would you like us to write about!</p>
<p>Don't hesitate to contact us: journal@efpsa.org!</p>
<p>We wish you the best in your future endeavours of scientific writing and publishing. Enjoy the blog!</p>
