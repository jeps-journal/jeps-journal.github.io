<p style="text-align: justify;">There is nothing as dull in a student's life as badly made PowerPoint presentations. Using PowerPoint has become a rule, whenever you present something in an university setting or otherwise. Everybody does it. And even when you follow all the hints on 'how to make a good presentations', like the ones <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://blog.efpsa.org/2011/10/01/551/">Maris talked about in our last post at the JEPS Bulletin</a></span>, you end up with <em>just </em>a PowerPoint presentation. How to change that and spice things up?</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class="size-full wp-image-567 aligncenter" title="prezi" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/prezi.jpg" alt="" width="210" height="90" /><!--more--></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Prezi is a free online presentation software. Its four strongest points are that it's: free, looks good, intuitive and new.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Free<br />
</strong>If you are a student, more often than not, you are on a tight budget. Prezi has its basic features (everything you need to make a presentation) freely accessible online. If you are interested in some improved features, you can always pay for them. But as it is, everybody can use it and access it, unlike our most common presentation software buddy, the PowerPoint.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Looks good<br />
</strong>What's even better about Prezi - it looks effective, engaging and really cool. Its zoom feature is in its core a pretty simple option, but with creative usage, it can make an ordinary presentation look like something completely different. Check out this <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://prezi.com/jipjiqvj6dsc/about-perspective/">presentation about the usage of perspectives in Prezi</a></span> (made, of course, in Prezi) to see what I'm talking about.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Intuitive<br />
</strong>When I first saw a Prezi presentation in a TED lecture online, the first thing that came to mind was: "That must be hard to make!" The truth couldn't be further from it. With a clean-cut and very minimal user interface, it manages to offer all its functions in a very intuitive way; very unlike our standard text processing or presentation software. The zooming is created through the use of framing - it's like setting check points for the camera to follow through your presentation. The site also offers video tutorials on how to use Prezi, which are very helpful even if you don't get the interface from the start.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>New<br />
</strong>With the widespread use of PowerPoint, different presentation software is rarely used. Even if you have a relatively dull topic to cover, with Prezi, the newness of the presentation style will surely keep your audience engaged and interested through the smart use of the zooming tool and the natural flow through the presentation it allows. Prezi's sheer newness for most people who haven't seen it will only be a plus. Just remember not to over use the zooming rotations, to avoid causing motion sickness to your audience!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As a conclusion, check out the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://prezi.com/jgm-lkf4txzs/jeps-presentation/">official Journal of European Psychology Students presentation</a> </span>done in Prezi. If you would like to present JEPS at your college, local student organization or conference, feel free to use it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Happy Prezi using!</p>
