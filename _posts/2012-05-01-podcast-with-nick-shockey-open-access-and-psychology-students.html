The workshop was attended by over 30 congress participants including the newly elected EFPSA President, Dalya Samur. It covered topics ranging from what <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a title="Open Access Basics" href="http://blog.efpsa.org/2011/05/15/open-access-basics/">Open Access is</a></span> to <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.righttoresearch.org/act/index.shtml">how students can get involved</a></span> in advocating Open Access at their universities and national and international organizations.</p>
<p>Since the workshop provoked great interest among the participants of the congress, we decided to make an interview* with Nick on the topic of open access journals and advocacy of open access, and what does all that mean to psychology students.</p>
