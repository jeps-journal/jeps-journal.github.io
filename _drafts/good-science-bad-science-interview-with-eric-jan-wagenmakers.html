<p>Pick any movie you like; chances are that if it includes an epic battle, there is always this one guy, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_LocaTzD10">wearing no helmet</a>, leading the army, striking down most of the enemies. Eric-Jan, “EJ”, Wagenmakers is this guy -- or at least the academic equivalent.</p>
<p>If you haven't lived under a rock for the last couple of years, you will have noticed that psychology is <a target="_blank" href="http://www.in-mind.org/article/a-perfect-storm-the-record-of-a-revolution">changing rapidly</a>. In <a target="_blank" href="http://ejwagenmakers.com/2012/Wagenmakers2012Horrors.pdf">2011</a> alone, the field was shaken by fraud cases like Diederik Stapel, and the publication of an article suggesting people can “feel the future” (Bem, 2011). This has lead psychologists to think hard about the current state of affairs, which resulted in introducing a new format of publishing and conducting experiments -- <a target="_blank" href="http://ejwagenmakers.com/2012/WagenmakersEtAl2012PoPS.pdf">pre-registration</a>. It has also emphasized the need for a better way to <a target="_blank" href="http://ejwagenmakers.com/inpress/BayesianScrutinyBook.pdf">analyze data</a>.</p>
<p>If you follow the links, you will notice that "EJ" has either spearheaded, or at least taken a focal part in these debates. Oh, and if you have read our <a target="_blank" href="http://blog.efpsa.org/2015/09/01/introducing-jasp-a-free-and-intuitive-statistics-software-that-might-finally-replace-spss/">previous</a> interview -- JASP is EJ’s brainchild.</p>
<p>How did he end up in psychology? What does he see as the most pressing problems, and what are his suggested solutions? How does he stay so <a target="_blank" href="http://ejwagenmakers.com/papers.html">immensely productive</a>? What is his advice for psychology students, and what can instructors learn from <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ejwagenmakers.com/GSBS/GSBS.html">"Good Science, Bad Science"</a>?</p>
<p><strong>I think a lot of people -- upon looking at your papers -- are wondering if your background really is psychology. Is it? And how did you came to be a psychologist?</strong></p>
<p><strong>To keep it concise, what are the three most misguided practices in current psychology?</strong></p>
<p><strong>You have been part of a lot of replication research (e.g. <a target="_blank" href="http://ejwagenmakers.com/2015/BoekelEtAl2015.pdf">this</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://ejwagenmakers.com/2015/WagenmakersEtAlWheelofTime2015.pdf">this</a>). Why is replication important, and what makes a good replication?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Scholarly dissemination is changing, with blog posts on the forefront. Can you recommend some good blogs for the student?</strong></p>
<p><strong>You collaborate very frequently with Richard Morey and Jeff Rouder; how important are these intensive collaborations in science?</strong></p>
