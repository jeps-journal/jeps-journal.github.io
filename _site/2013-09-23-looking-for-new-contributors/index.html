The JEPS Bulletin aims to connect psychology students from all over Europe by providing a unique platform for learning and sharing of knowledge, and subsequently, serving as an indispensable companion for students in the process of conducting and reporting psychological research. The JEPS Bulletin is proud to have a great number of active Contributors who are psychology students throughout Europe. Currently, the JEPS Bulletin is recruiting new Contributors so in case you want to be part of the list on your left keep reading.</p>

<p>If you have critical research-related topics to post about that can no longer be hidden from the academic world, or if you have a topic that you think fits into the focus of the JEPS Bulletin, we encourage you to become a <strong>JEPS Bulletin Contributor.</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong><b>Your application should include:</b></p>
<p><b>1.</b> An<b> abstract </b>(between 150-300 words) and key references of the topic you wish to write about. You may write on a topic of your choice if it fits with the Bulletin's theme, or you may pick a topic from our list of suggestions (see below).</p>
<p><b>2.</b> A short <b>motivation letter</b> outlining your interest in JEPS, psychology, previous writing experience, personal information, etc. Your motivation letter can be short (i.e., one or two paragraphs).</p>
<p><b>Requirements:</b></p>
<p><b>1.</b> Proficiency in English</p>
<p><b>2.</b> Experience in writing</p>
<p>There is no deadline for applying, as the JEPS Bulletin always accepts blog post submissions. Nonetheless, we encourage potential Contributors to contact us as soon as possible because we operate on a "first come, first served" basis and the longer you wait for applying, the likelier it gets that your post will be published at a later time. When you are done send the application to <strong>journal@efpsa.org.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Suggested  topics list:</b></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>How to choose a journal to publish in?</strong> – What are the criteria when choosing the journal to publish one’s article? What different types of scientific journals are there?</li>
<li><strong>How do advancements in the field of statistics find their way into psychological research?</strong> –  After all, psychologists use statistical methods as a tool, but they often don't understand them to the point where they can decide whether a new method is better than what they are currently using. It's like being able to drive a car (and being very good at it) without knowing how to repair it.</li>
<li><strong>How do psychologists collaborate with researchers in other fields?</strong> –  Or how do psychologists work on a research project when some of the colleagues work in different parts of the world? What initiates this collaboration? What problems are most often encountered? What are the advantages/disadvantages?</li>
<li><strong>How do researchers choose the studies they want to conduct?</strong> – Research costs money and therefore it would be interesting to know what influences a researcher's decision to conduct a certain study. Is it only suggestions for future research from conlusions of previous publications?</li>
<li><strong>Putting bread on the table with psychology</strong>  –  How psychologists earn their money, how much you earn depending on what you do and where you work, searching for funding, additional sources of income, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Getting a PhD position</strong> – What is the strategy one should adopt in order to get a PhD position? What are the different searching techniques? Which are the most viable?</li>
<li><strong>Writing a M.A. / PhD proposal</strong>  –  The steps and structure behind writing an M.A. / PhD proposal.</li>
<li><strong>Free academic vacations: Summer schools</strong>  –  What is the added-value of participating in a Summer School? What kinds of summer schools are there out there?</li>
<li><strong>Crowdsource your research</strong> – What does this new fancy term mean? How to get there and what are the benefits of pursuing this type of funding?</li>
<li><strong>Online Experimentation</strong> – Is online experimentation a viable option to conduct valid research? What are the pros and cons? Which software is the most appropriate and why?</li>
<li><strong>New methods to discover fraud in psychology research (e.g. p-curving)</strong> –  With new scandals of fraud and data manipulation popping up all over the globe what can psychologists do to discover and expose these cases of mispractice in an effective manner?</li>
<li><strong>The Bem-Feeling-the-future debate</strong> – What might be the problem in using standard significance tests (e.g. Fisher's approach) when you do not have a theory (and no real hypothesis)?</li>
<li><strong>How to analyse and interpret your data (in general)</strong> –  What are the most viable procedures when analysing and interpreting data and why?</li>
<li><strong>Reviewer's experience on common mistakes in manuscript</strong> – Which mistakes are the most common when reviewing manuscripts?</li>
<li><strong>Choosing a methodology for your research</strong> – How to choose from the different procedures and methodologies? What are the criteria when choosing a certain methodology to conduct research? What are the pros and cons?</li>
<li><strong>The importance of ethical and risk assessment for your research</strong> – What is the role and importance of ethical and risk assessment when conducting research? Also, how can the author benefit from these?</li>
<li><strong>Author's experience in getting research published on an academic journal</strong> – An insiders look on the process getting published on a scientific journal.</li>
<li><strong>How to organize one's research in the process of dissertation writing</strong> – What should the author pay attention to when conducting dissertation writing.</li>
</ul>
